# ML-2a
## Project Name: 
This is a Machine Learning Project 2a - House Pricing Prediction.
## Project Description: 
Building a Machine Learning Model to predict the House Pricing based on other influencing factors like Area, Main-road, Bedroom, Basement etc.
Dataset: It has 13 attributes including Price.
Link for Dataset: Attached

## Objective: 
To create an ML Model which can predict Housing Price.

## Tools & Methodologies:
Libraries Used: sklearn, model_selection, train_test_split
Statistics Used: Multiple Linear Regression, Various Inflation Factors, p-value, Recursive Feature Elimination
Checked Performance Using: mean_squared_error and r_squared

## Result:

mean_squared_error:  0.01170800290494533 # Meaning our model is not able to predict correctly 0.01% saying in other way model was 99% accurate.
r_squared:   0.6021721774706439          # Meaning in real life data if R^2 value is 60 and above, it is a good model. So, this is a good model
